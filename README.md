# Algo challenges!

How to participate?

- clone this repo
- install npm dependencies `npm i`
- run it! `npm start`

And then, try to solve some algos:

- challenges are described in `src/challenges.ts` file
- you can take a look at the input and ouput in the `src/data.ts` file if needed!
- pick the algo you want to work on and copy/paste the method signature into the class body of the `src/answers.ts` file. Add a body to the method, and do some stuff!

When you think you'r good, then just save you `src/answers.ts` file and check the result in the console!
