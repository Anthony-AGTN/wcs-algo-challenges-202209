# Algo challenges!

How to participate?

- clone this repo
- install npm dependencies `npm i`
- run it! `npm start`

And then, try to solve some algos:

- challenges are located in the `./src/challenges` folder
- each challenge folder (from A1 to B5) contains a challenge! You'll find for each challenge : 
    - an `answer.ts` file with the challenge explaination, and the function to fill!
    - an `input.ts` file with the input that will be used!
    - an `output.ts` file with the output expected
- choose the challenge you want to work on, uncomment the `export default function ...` in the `answer.ts` file and try to solve it! Don't hesitate to read the challenge explaination and take a look, if needed to the `input.ts` and `output.ts` files! 

When you think you'r good, then just save you `answers.ts` file and check the result in the console! If the live reloading is not working anymore, just relaunch it!

## Types

All the challenges are strongly typed, take a look at the interfaces definition to get more information! Each challenge folder contains its own interfaces.
